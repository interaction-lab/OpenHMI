This pattern was created with Size 4 (aran weight) yarn and size H/5.0mm crochet hook.

### Terms/Abbreviations:
st = stitch

sl st = slip stitch

sc = single crochet

dc = double crochet

hdc = half double crochet

dc2 = 2 double crochets in 1 stitch

decrease = dc2tog = double crochet 2 together

### Notes:
Ch2 at the end of each row does not count as a dc. Ends of rows will be hidden behind the robot when assembled.

Use stitch markers to help keep track of increases and decreases. I like to use five 12-inch strands of yarn in a contrasting color to mark the increases in rows 2 and 3 of the body, then use the same 5 pieces of yarn to mark increases in subsequent rows. 

Body construction: The first row of the body is worked flat to prevent twisting, then the remaining rows are worked in a spiral for a seamless look. The first few stitches of the spiral are intentionally worked in a sc and hdc to create a smooth transition.

# Pattern

## Body

(neck down construction, worked in the round)

Note: 

Chain 32 and turn 

Row 1: dc into 3rd chain from the hook, dc across, do not turn (30)

Row 2: Begin working in a spiral: sc into the top of the first dc of row 1, hdc into the second dc, dc across, making increases (dc2) approx 1/6, 1/2, and 5/6 of the way around (in stitches 5, 15, and 25)

Row 3: dc across, making increases approx 1/3 and 2/3 of the way around (in stitches 10 and 20)

Rows 4-16: Repeat rows 2 and 3 (68)

Row 17: dc across, making decreases about ¼, ½, and ¾ of the way through the row

Row 18: hdc across, sc in the last two stitches to even out the spiral, and fasten off

## Head

(neck up construction, worked in the round until row 8)

Work into the opposite side of the starting chain 30

Row 1: sc, hdc, dc2 into the same stitch, \*2 dc, dc2\* repeat from \* to \* across, do not turn (40)

Row 2: Start spiral: \*3 dc, dc2\* repeat from \* to \* across (50)
Row 3: \*4 dc, dc2\* repeat from \* to \* across (60)
Row 4-8: dc across (60)
(remaining rows are worked flat)
Row 9: \*10 dc, decrease\* repeat from \* to \* across, chain 2 and turn (55)
Row 10: \*9 dc, decrease\* repeat from \* to \* across, chain 2 and turn (50)
Row 11: \*8 dc, decrease\* repeat from \* to \* across, fasten off (45)

## Eyes and Nose

Nose: attach in center between rows 3 and 4 of the head

Eyes: attach between rows 6 and 7 of the head approx. 8 sts away from the nose on both sides

For best results, put your blank skin on the robot frame and mark the desired placement of the eyes and nose before attaching.

## Dressing the Robot Frame

Remove the head from the robot's frame, noting which direction the robot is facing (nose should align with motor 1). Place the cover over the the tower, then replace the head frame and pull the top of the cover over the head frame. With a yarn needle, use the tail attached to the head flap to sew up the back of the head and secure the flap.
